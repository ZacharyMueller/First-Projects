This is my official first ever python project just completed today. It is the classic snake game, but I couldn't figure out how to add text onto the screen for the score... but whatever.
I did this without following tutorials, but I did get some help from a redditor who helped me look at it in a different way, which helped a lot! Big Thanks to them!

It's called Snake 2 because I wewrote it multiple times so it just happens to be called that.

Bassically the snake moves by each snake body moving to the position of the next one... kinda like follow the leader. The 'leader' is updated based on a direction from keyboard input.
